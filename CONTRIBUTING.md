# Directory Structure

commands are put inside ``commands`` folder.
then, you must have a seperate folder for your command.

You will also need a ``package.json`` inside your command's Directory
otherwise you will indefinitely crash the bot at init.

We follow the ES6 and the ES5 Standards coding structure. We recommend
you to use ES6 for your code.


# Pull Requests

It will not be merged until it's fixed.
