He'd trade his guns for love
But he's caught in the crossfire
And he keeps wakin' up
But it's not to the sound of birds
The tyranny, the violent streets
Deprived of all that we're blessed with
And we can't get enough, no
Heaven if you sent us down
So we could build a playground
For the sinners to play as saints
You'd be so proud of what we've made
I hope you got some beds around
'Cause you're the only refuge now
For every mother, every child, every brother
That's caught in the crossfire
That's caught in the crossfire
I'd trade my luck to know
Why he's caught in the crossfire
And I'm here wakin' up
To the sun and the sound of birds
Society's anxiety
Deprived of all that we're blessed with
We just can't get enough, no!
Heaven if you sent us down
So we could build a playground
For the sinners to play as saints
You'd be so proud of what we've made
I hope you got some beds around
'Cause you're the only refuge now
For every mother, every child, every brother
That's caught in the crossfire!
That's caught in the crossfire!
Can I trust what I'm given?
When faith still needs a gun
Whose ammunition justifies the wrong?
And I can't see from the backseat
So I'm asking from above
Can I trust what I'm given, even when it cuts?
So Heaven if you sent us down
So we could build a playground
For the sinners to play as saints
You'd be so proud of what we made
I hope you got some beds around
'Cause you're the only refuge now
For every mother, every child, every brother
That's caught in the crossfire!
Who's caught in the crossfire
Who's caught in the crossfire
(Who's caught in the crossfire, baby baby)
Who's caught on the cross
I'm calling this the love crusade
The truth is like a black bouquet
Money's got us all enslaved
The bullets and the bombs we make, oh, no
It doesn't have to be this way
But I promise it'll stay this way
If you would rather hear me say
That everything is all okay
I don't care for your drugs, I don't care for your fame
Do you care for the truth if you're not entertained?
I can see through your eyes, I can see through your pain
And you're scared to admit, you feel out of place
Can you hear that, darling?
A revolution's calling
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that, darling?
The monster's marching
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love
Sincerely
I'm telling you, the world looks perfect from a plane
A couple miles up and we all look the same
One love tryna show us the way
One love that is trying to change
And if we connect with that, then we should be enraged
These fat cats want us lost in the maze
And they're scared 'cause we're breaking the chain
They're scared 'cause we're 'bout to escape
Can you hear that, darling?
A revolution's calling
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that, darling?
The monster's marching
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love
Sincerely
There's a billion people
That could use a hero
Come together, we're the tether
Of this love that's spinning 'round
We could be that miracle
Can you hear that, darling?
A revolution's calling
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that, darling?
The monster's marching
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love
Sincerely
You're not going through it
It's going through you
And once it's all gone
You become the new you
With a different perspective
From the same point of view
Fully unaffected by the old truth you once knew
Connected at the roots, to the trunk to the branches
To the leaves and the way the fly away
When wind dances
A frantic see saw free fall in mid air
That represents the floating folly of us being here
We're complicated creatures huh
Come away, come away
Cause I love my soul
A fighter in need
A lover astray
Now telling you it's not for gold
Come away, come away
Come away, come away
Cause I know I won't
A fire in me
The trouble I see
Heaven won't you let me go?
This is it
Apocalypse
I feel now
I feel it
This is it
Apocalypse
I fear it now
I fear now
I'm dreaming I can start a fire
I'm dreaming I can start a fire
I've come a way, come a way
But further I'll go
Whenever these leaves are ready to fall
Cut me down, cut me down
Come away, come away
From all that I know
To all that I need
It's nothing at all
Heaven won't you let me go?
This is it
Apocalypse
They'll feel me now (come on)
They'll feel me now
This is it
Apocalypse
They'll fear it now
They'll fear it now
I'm dreaming I'm a start a fire
Why is this happening to me
Why is this happening for me
Only one word has changed
But it's a completely different story
Are you gonna dance?
Are you gonna cry?
This is your life, oh
Are you making plans?
Are you gonna try?
This is your life
Hey, I know you saw some things
That you didn't expect to
Nobody to help you
Listen close
Cause what you keep
Is never goin' leave you
It's only gonna leave you
With the long nights of cold sweat
Searching for the silence you can't get
It only takes a couple months
To know everything you love
And now you can't look at yourself
Crying till the hot water runs out
Cutting is the only way to find what you keep inside
Are you gonna dance?
Are you gonna cry?
This is your life, oh
Are you making plans?
Are you gonna try?
This is your life
Every time I seem to make these same mistakes
Cause every time I think I finally found my way
It's always the memories that make it hard to change
It's only a memory
So are you gonna dance?
Are you gonna cry?
This is your life
Yea, this is your life
Are you gonna dance?
Are you gonna cry?
This is your life, oh
Are you making plans?
Are you gonna try?
This is your life
Baby we can make it
Pull me off the pavement
Bring me back to basics
Ever since I left you
You took a part of me I can't replace it
I'm half of what I came with
Carrying the same weight
Now I need a rescue
To pick me up
And make me right
Remind me what I felt
Before I went away
Tonight I need your help
Remembering myself
Take me right back to the start
Fantasize we ain't apart
Woah, woah
And it feels like I can't get enough
Tonight I need your help
Remembering myself
You told me to embrace it
Everything is changing
Get up off the pavement
You used to be dreamer
And now you ain't afraid to go chase it
So all thats left to say is
Alone you have to face it
I wanna feel you once more
Before we have to say goodbye
Remind me what I felt
Before I went away
Tonight I need your help
Remembering myself
Take me right back to the start
Fantasise we ain't apart
Woah, woah
And it feels like I can't get enough
Tonight I need your help
Remembering myself, remembering myself
It feels good to lie that I'm alive without myself
It feels good to lie that I'm alive
It feels good to lie that I'm alive without myself
It feels good to lie that I'm alive that I'm alive
And it feels like I can't get enough
Tonight I need your help
Remembering myself
