A really experimental (and borked) Discord.js bot written in ECMAScript 6

# Building and Running
This Script has been proven to work on Node v6 and above
We cannot assure complete functionality on Node v4 and below.

NOTE: you need a installation of Node.js from the *NVM Repositroy*, this is possible by installing [nvm](http://nvm.sh) and make the following Node Environments your default (you can only set one).
Linux users require this since the official packages in some distros like Ubuntu only has 4.x.x.
