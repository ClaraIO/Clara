# owo-whats-this [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sr229/owo-whats-this.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sr229/owo-whats-this)
A really experimental (and borked) Discord.js bot written in EsNEXT (Es6)

# Running

From a fresh download/clone, you cannot run the script directly. You have to compile it using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) in order to make it work through Node.js

``npm -g install babel babel-cli`` and use the 'ES2015' preset for Babel.

the rest is pretty straightforward if you've used Babel before.

# Testing

Contributions/commits/PRs are tested by Travis CI. If your PR fails, it won't be merged until it is fixed.
This is to make sure the cocurrent code would work on optimum state.
