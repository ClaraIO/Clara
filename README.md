# owo-whats-this [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sr229/owo-whats-this.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sr229/owo-whats-this)
A really experimental (and borked) Discord.js bot written in EsNEXT (Es6)

# Building and Running

From a fresh download/clone, you cannot run the script directly. You have to compile it using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) in order to make it work through Node.js

append to you terminal the following:
```sh
$ npm install -g babel-cli babel
$ npm install babel-preset-es2015 --save
```
then run:
```sh
$ babel -D -d out --no-comments src```

if you've used Babel before, it's really easy.

then navigate to your ``out`` folder and run ``node bot.js``.

NOTE: you need a installation of Node v6.6.0 or v6.1.0, this is possible by installing [nvm](http://nvm.sh)and make the following Node Environments your default (you can only set one).
Linux users require this since the official packages in some distros like Ubuntu only has 4.x.x. We hadn't tested against 4.xx.

# Testing

Contributions/commits/PRs are tested by Travis CI. If your PR fails, it won't be merged until it is fixed.
This is to make sure the cocurrent code would work on optimum state.
