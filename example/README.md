### Command Examples

This is where the command examples are stored.

For the current system, go to the ``0.4.x`` folder.

However, if you wanna see the new 1.x spec in coding practice, go to ``1.x`` folder.

DO NOT code the 1.x spec in 0.4.x as this is not yet implemented and is slated for a future release designated.
