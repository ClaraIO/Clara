## Special Thanks

Without them, Project Clara would not have been the bot you've loved.

[@Ovyerus](https://github.com/Ovyerus) - Been with here since the beginning. Did most of the stuff with @sr229.

[@sr229](https://github.com/sr229) - Started this project to start a movement for standardized, optimized and easy to host code on Discord bots' creation.

[@Aurieh](https://github.com/aurieh) - Docker help

[@chalda](https://github.com/chalda) - Without his amazing work on the original plugin system on his bot, Clara would have been less easier to make commands with. Clara was mostly based on the design his bot was made with.
